# Module-2-Evaluation

This is the evaluation for Module 2 of the devMint Course. You are starting with a blank repository and are expected to add a fully functioning repository with the following contracts:

- ERC20 Contract called `token.sol`
- Faucet Contract called `faucet.sol`
- Faucet Details Contract called `faucet_details.sol`
- Faucet Updated to include the details import called `faucet_including_details.sl`
- A custom ERC721 contract called `nft.sol`

You should also have scripts that prove the following:

- A script that shows the main Faucet test cases called `faucet_test_case.js`
- A script that shows the Faucet including details test cases called `faucet_with_details_test_case.js`
- A script that shows the NFT for the token community test cases called `nft_test_case.js`

You can use any of the documentation, wizards or supplementatl details to help you build this. This is a graded evaluation, so please do not ask your peers for support. If you have any questions, directly message your instructor.
